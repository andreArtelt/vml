Visualization of Machine Learning

## About
VML is a web-based **interactive learning tool** for **machine learning**. Several algorithms are implemented and can be explored in an easy and interactive way (**no programming needed**) using a web browser.

"Modern" (Javascript) web browser is needed only (**no installation required**)!

The aim is to help students **getting a better understanding** about the behavior of machine learning algorithms.
- What are they doing?
- How do they behave on different datasets?
- What effects have certain (hyper-)parameters?

## Features (Algorithms)
 - Generating toy datasets
 - Perceptron
 - K-Means clustering
 - Polynomial regression
