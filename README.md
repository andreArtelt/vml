Visualization of Machine Learning

## About
VML is a web-based **interactive learning tool** for **machine learning**. Several algorithms are implemented and can be explored in an easy and interactive way (**no programming needed**) using a web browser.

"Modern" (Javascript) web browser is needed only (**no installation required**)!

The aim is to help students **getting a better understanding** about the behavior of machine learning algorithms.
- What are they doing?
- How do they behave on different datasets?
- What effects do certain (hyper-)parameters have?

## Features (Algorithms)
 - Generating toy datasets
 - Perceptron
 - Support vector machine (SVM)
 - Polynomial regression
 - Bayesian Linear Regression
 - Naive Bayes classification
 - Logistic regression
 - Decision tree
 - Learning vector quantization (LVQ)
 - K-Means clustering
 - Gaussian mixture
 - K nearest neighbors (knn)

## Webdemo
[Current release](https://andreartelt.github.io/vml)

## Documentation
See [wiki](https://github.com/andreArtelt/vml/wiki).

## Technical stuff
This project is realized using *HTML5*, *JavaScript* and *CSS3*.

## How to build?
Make sure you have installed [nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs), [vulcanize](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize) and [jsdoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc).

Execute from the root directory  
`node build.js`  
This will build the website and the documentation.
